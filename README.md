# Governement_operational_research

## About
In this project, I showcased my involvement in a government operational research project focused on evaluating the outcomes of an electronic monitoring pilot program. This comprehensive analysis involved working with two distinct datasets, one containing information about tagged offenders and the other containing data on offenders who violated program rules.
The primary objective of this research was to uncover valuable insights regarding the demographic characteristics of the offenders involved in the program.

## Findings
The analysis revealed that out of the 176 individuals who violated the pilot program, approximately 53% were male, while the remaining offenders were female. Notably, a majority of these offenders fell within the age group of 51 and older. Additionally, the analysis indicated that most of these individuals had prior tags related to curfew, location, or alcohol offenses, with a significant proportion having a history of curfew violations. Moreover, the majority of these offenses occurred during the month of April.

## Conclusion
This project shed light on important trends and patterns within the offender population, contributing to a better understanding of the electronic monitoring program's effectiveness and its impact on different demographic groups.
